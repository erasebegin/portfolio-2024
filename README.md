## Chris Haupt's Portfolio Website
### Built using React, TypeScript, Vite and Chakra UI

#### To run locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:5173`

#### Todo:

- [ ] make whiteboard text svgs respond to dark mode
- [ ] improve hero button layout for skills open state on desktop
- [ ] add buttons to project modals
- [ ] fix thin visible line between section divider that only appears on mobile
- [ ] when collapsing a section, the page jumps towards the end of the animation, this is due to the description text not exiting smoothly
- [ ] year text on thumbnails (when section expanded) doesn't provide enough contrast, hard to read
